Hello! You can view the writeup, script log, and data outputs from the default parameters (10 iterations, 2000000 decks per iteration) attesting/outputs/default.
The tests with the default parameters take about 3 minutes on a 13th Gen Intel i7 CPU with 16GB of RAM, so they may take longer depending on how beefy your setup is.
(Please be nice, I did not write strong input validation)
Would you like to run tests with custom parameters (y) or rerun the default tests (n)? (y/n): n
running tests for Method 1 (10 iterations, 2000000 decks per iteration)
compiling Method 1 data
running tests for Method 2 (10 iterations, 2000000 decks per iteration)
compiling Method 2 data
done!
